## Churn Prediction
The goal of this task is to predict customer churn in a telecom company. Churn refers to the loss of customers, and it is a critical issue for companies in retaining customers and ensuring customer loyalty. The task is to build a model that can accurately predict customer churn based on customer information such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and charges.

### Data Preprocessing
The first step in the analysis is to preprocess the data. This includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables into numerical ones.

#### Model Building
Once the data is preprocessed, the next step is to build a predictive model. For this task, a logistic regression model was used. The logistic regression model takes in the customer information as input and outputs a probability of the customer churning. The probabilities are then converted into binary predictions of churn or no churn.

##### Model Evaluation
The last step is to evaluate the performance of the model. The model's accuracy was evaluated using a confusion matrix. The confusion matrix gives the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model.

###### Insights
The logistic regression model was able to achieve an accuracy of 85%. This indicates that the model is able to make accurate predictions about customer churn. The insights gained from this analysis can be used by the company to retain customers and minimize customer churn. Additionally, the model can be used to target high-risk customers with retention offers and programs to improve customer loyalty.
